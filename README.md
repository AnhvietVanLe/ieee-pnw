# README

Hello my name is Anhviet Le, I'm a student at Purdue University Northwest.
Here is my membership tracking app for PNW IEEE members.

Currently named: IEEE-PNW CONNECT

This app is in alpha stages of development.

Sources: I learned Ruby on Rails from a few YouTube video but the most useful and impactful video is "Learn Ruby on Rails - Full Course" by freeCodeCamp.org
